# SentinelReporter

Sentinel Reporter is a small userscript that adds controls to posts on Sentinel to give feedback directly from the site, instead of switching back to the [SOBotics chat room](https://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/111347) and prepare the message there. MetaSmoke has [such a feature natively](https://i.imgur.com/x3Phvci.png).

## Usage

Follow the browser-specific instructions below. If you installed it correctly, the controls should have appeared below the title in a Sentinel report:

## Notes

This was written and tested with Tampermonkey 4.5 in Google Chrome. If you are using Greasemonkey, please inform me about possible issues and I will see if I can get it fixed.
